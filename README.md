# Word-Search-Engine

A word search engine is a search webpage in which we can search the words. This project is a very small part of a word search engine.
This is just a demonstration of search feature page design.

### Getting Started

When someone types the word in search field on the developed web page, then
the program displays the probable words as well as their searched counts.
I have stored 5 names as well as their updating counts in databases through which 
when keyword is pressing then at same time JSP code receives the typed keyword and searches for the probable words.

### Prerequisites

1. MS SQL Server Database: I am using it through Micosoft Azure Cloud<br/>
2. Apache Tomcat Server and relevant library jar file "sqljdbc42.jar" in lib directory of tomcat
